## General Information
- The aim of creatinig this project was to learn how to use the JavaScript library "jQuery" in JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
- jQuery

## Rules to Play The Game
-  Press the a key on keyboard. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.

- Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.

- Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

- Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of sig- nals correctly. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon automatically speeds up.

- If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more than 5 seconds to repeat a signal, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
